## Enable pytest and refactor FastAPI app â€¦ (4ac6520)

Enable pytest and simplify FastAPI app structure

Switches the testing framework to pytest with configuration updates and refactors the FastAPI app by removing unused endpoints and simplifying imports for better maintainability.

### Changes
- Enabled `pytest` in `.vscode/settings.json` and disabled `unittest`.
- Added `python.testing.pytestArgs` to specify `trading-system` as the test target.
- Removed unused endpoints (`/`, `/health`, `/webhook/tradingview`) in `trading-system/app/main.py`.
- Simplified imports in `trading-system/app/main.py` by removing unused modules.

### Impact
- Behavioral changes: The FastAPI app no longer has the removed endpoints, reducing its functionality.
- Dependencies affected: Testing configuration now relies on `pytest` instead of `unittest`.
- Breaking changes: Consumers of the removed endpoints will need to update their usage.
- Performance implications: Potentially improved performance due to reduced app complexity.
